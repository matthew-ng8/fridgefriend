# fridgefriend: an organizational app for android lollipop (version 22) and above.

## Description
In shared living spaces, we run into this issue to buying duplicates of what is already in the fridge. We often ask ourselves, "I wonder if we have this at home?". You'll buy a quart of milk and come back to a fridge that already has a gallon of milk in it. This is where fridgefriend comes into play. A group of suitemates or family members will be apart of a fridgegroup and work together to organize items in their fridge.For college students, they can keep track of each fridge. For those who travel, they can check their fridge before coming home. 

## Demostration
Under construction.

## Installation
To run this application, please download this project. Open Android Studio and run the MainActivity.java on your android device. You'll need a Google Email to sign in. 

## Using the Application
To use this application, start by signing with your Google Email. You will be guided to the home page to add a new fridgefriend group or you can add an existing fridgefriend group. From there, you can navigate using the bottom bar to see what's in your fridge and shopping list. In the settings fragment, you can see your groups, allergies, and delete your account if needed.

## Authors and Acknowledgement 
This project could not have been completed without the teamwork between Jessica Li and Matthew Ng. 

## Current Project Status
This project can currently add fridgegroups, add items to both fridge and shopping list, uses Firebase database, and Google Authnetication. Future features that we hope to accomplish are: map feature to find the closest grocery store, alert user of items that contain your allergies or a friend's allergies, incorporate a larger database for barcodes, add a personal list for your own items, and alert user of expiring items.
